=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyApp;

  use parent 'Zing::Worker';

  sub handle {
    my ($name, $data) = @_;

    [$name, $data];
  }

  sub perform {
    time;
  }

  sub queues {
    ['todos'];
  }

  sub receive {

  }

  package main;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a L<Zing::Process> which listens to one or more queues
calls the C<handle> method for each new message received. The standard process
C<perform> and C<receive> methods operate as expected.

=head1 SCENARIOS

This package supports the following scenarios:

=cut

=head2 handle

  # given: synopsis

  $myapp->handle('todos', { todo => 'rebuild' });

The handle method is meant to be implemented by a subclass and is
automatically invoked when a message is received from a defined queue.

=cut

=head2 perform

  # given: synopsis

  $myapp->perform;

The perform method is meant to be implemented by a subclass and is
automatically invoked iteratively by the event-loop.

=cut

=head2 queues

  # given: synopsis

  $myapp->queues;

The queues method is meant to be implemented by a subclass and is automatically
invoked when the process is executed.

=cut

=head2 receive

  # given: synopsis

  $myapp->receive($myapp->name, { status => 'ok' });

The receive method is meant to be implemented by a subclass and is
automatically invoked iteratively by the event-loop.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This package has the following attributes:

=cut

=head2 on_handle

  on_handle(Maybe[CodeRef])

This attribute is read-only, accepts C<(Maybe[CodeRef])> values, and is optional.

=cut

=head2 on_queues

=head1 METHODS

This package implements the following methods:

=cut

=head2 handle

  handle(Str $queue, HashRef $data) : Any

The handle method, when not overloaded, executes the callback in the
L</on_handle> attribute for each new message available in any of the queues
delcared.

=item handle example #1

  my $worker = Zing::Worker->new(
    on_handle => sub {
      my ($self, $queue, $data) = @_;
      [$queue, $data];
    },
  );

  $worker->handle('todos', {});

=back

=cut

=head2 queues

  queues(Any @args) : ArrayRef[Str]

The queues method, when not overloaded, executes the callback in the
L</on_queues> attribute and expects a list of named queues to be processed.

=item queues example #1

  my $worker = Zing::Worker->new(
    on_queues => sub {
      ['todos'];
    },
  );

  $worker->queues;

=item queues example #2

  my $worker = Zing::Worker->new(
    on_queues => sub {
      my ($self, @queues) = @_;
      [@queues, 'other'];
    },
  );

  $worker->queues('todos-p1', 'todos-p2', 'todos-p3');
