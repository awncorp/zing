  # given: synopsis

  $myapp->schedules;

  # schedule structure
  # [$interval, $queues, $message, $adjustment]

  # predefined schedules

  # @annually is at 00:00 on day-of-month 1 in january
  # @daily is at 00:00 every day
  # @hourly is at minute 0 every hour
  # @minute is at every minute
  # @monthly is at 00:00 on day-of-month 1
  # @weekend is at 00:00 on saturday
  # @weekly is at 00:00 on monday
  # @yearly is at 00:00 on day-of-month 1 in january

  # other schedule examples

  # every minute
  # ['* * * * *', ['tasks'], { do => 1 }]

  # every hour (on the half hour)
  # ['30 * * * *', ['tasks'], { do => 1 }]

  # every 15th minute
  # ['*/15 * * * *', ['tasks'], { do => 1 }]

The schedules method is meant to be implemented by a subclass and is
automatically invoked when the process is executed, it should return a list of
schedules. A single schedule takes the form of C<[$interval, $queues,
$message]> where C<$interval> is represented as a cron-expression or using one
of the predefined interval name, e.g. C<@yearly>, C<@annually>, C<@monthly>,
C<@weekly>, C<@weekend>, C<@daily>, C<@hourly>, or C<@minute>.
