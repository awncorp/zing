=head1 METHODS

This package implements the following methods:

=cut

  # given: synopsis

  $process->defer({ task => { launch => time } });

=back

=cut

=head2 destroy

  destroy() : Object

stores.

=over 4

=item destroy example #1

  # given: synopsis

  $process->destroy;

=back

=cut

=head2 execute

  execute() : Object

The execute method executes the process event-loop indefinitely.

=over 4

=item execute example #1

  $process->metadata;

=back

=cut

=head2 ping

  ping(Int $pid) : Bool

  $process->ping(12345);

=back

=cut

=head2 recv

  recv() : Maybe[HashRef]

  $process->recv;

=back

=cut

=head2 reply

  reply(HashRef $bag, HashRef $value) : Int

The reply method is a proxy for L<Zing::Mailbox/reply> and sends a message to
the mailbox represented by the C<$bag> received.

=over 4

=item reply example #1

  # given: synopsis

  my $peer = Zing::Process->new;

  $peer->send($process, { note => 'ehlo' });

  my $mail = $process->recv;

=back

=cut

=head2 send

  send(Mailbox | Process | Str $to, HashRef $data) : Int
