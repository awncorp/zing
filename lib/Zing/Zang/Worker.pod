This package provides a L<Zing::Worker> which uses callbacks and doesn't need
to be subclassd. It supports providing a process C<perform> method as
C<on_perform> and a C<receive> method as C<on_receive> which operate as
expected, and also a C<handle> method as C<on_handle> which is executed
whenever a message is received from one of the queue(s).
