=pod explain

- zing-watcher is a process, see ./examples/00-zing-process ...
- but more specifically is a supervisor process
- it's a class which is intended to be subclassed
- a Watcher process launches (fork()) and monitors other processes
- because a Watcher is also a Process, it runs its own event-loop ...
- and invokes the perform() and receive() handlers respectively ...
- meaning that Watcher processes can multitask too
- the process is usually enacted by calling execute()
- execute() starts the process event-loop
