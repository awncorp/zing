- see ./examples/00-zing-zang

- zing-ring joins process event-loops by acting as a turn-based actuator
- the zing-ring is itself a process which can be executed and watched
- only one process in the collection is executed per loop cycle
- when the ring is shutdown() it will shutdown() all processes in the collection
