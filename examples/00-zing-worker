=pod explain

- zing-worker is a process, see ./examples/00-zing-process ...
- but more specifically is a worker process that listens to 1+ queue(s) ...
- and invokes the user-defined receive() method when new messages arrive
- it's a class which is intended to be subclassed
- because a Worker is also a Process, it runs its own event-loop
- it invokes the perform() method at every event-loop tick
- it invokes the receive() method when a new message is received
- as with all other process types, a Worker process can multitask
- the process is usually enacted by calling execute()
- execute() starts the process event-loop
