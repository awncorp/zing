=pod explain

- zing-kernel is the core Watcher process
- it's not strictly necessary but does serve one essential function ...
- i.e. processes ship logs to a known channel which the kernel collects from ...
- which is how log-shipping is done
- the kernel is automatically bootstrapped when apps are launched with Zing ...
- or anything under the Zing/Zang namespace
