=pod explain

- zing is the main module
- it is also a process itself, a Watcher process
- it loads (and forks) a scheme
- it is actually a special kind of Watcher
- i.e. it loads a kernel process which loads the scheme
- as a watcher, it maintains the specified number of forks
- the supervisor tree is zing -> kernel -> app

=cut

my $z = Zing->new(scheme => ['MyApp::Time', [], 1]);

$z->start;
